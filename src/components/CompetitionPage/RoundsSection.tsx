                        The American Regional Biology Competition is open to all
                        high school students and some exceptional middle school
                        students (Reach out to our email to see if you're
                        applicable) in America. Our regional competition is
                        oriented around giving students the best introduction to
                        competitive biology and bridging the gap between
                        beginner biology (AP Biology and IB Biology) and
                        Advanced Biology (USABO). The competition has four
                        rounds: Individual, team, paper, and wave rounds. The
                        rounds' descriptions are listed below. Out of all teams,
                        a select number of teams that performed the best will
                        proceed to the national round and compete with
                        representatives from other states. Only the first four
                        rounds are held in person while the national round is
                        held online.
