                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are a 501c3 volunteer run, nonprofit organization
                        that operates year-round to make biology accessible to
                        students and bridge the gap between beginner biology and
                        competitive biology. We are in our third year as a
                        organization and have experienced immense growth since
                        our inaugural year. We are currently projected to hold
                        competitions in <b>16 regions across the nation.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The funds given will go directly to us in an effort to
                        further increase participation and making biology
                        accessible. We will be raising money up till the date of
                        the competition and would be grateful for anything you
                        are able to give. We appreciate you all in advance.

                    <h2>Funding Objectives</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to keep the competition as accessible as
                        possible while still providing a quality experience, we
                        request your support via donations. Our volunteer staff
                        takes care of event planning, competition writing, and
                        organization administration, but there are still some
                        aspects of the competition that cannot be covered
                        entirely by our student volunteers. Furthermore, we
                        would like to offer grants to low or mixed-income/Title
                        1 schools to be able to purchase materials as well as
                        afford transportation and competition fees.
